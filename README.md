pain pain pain pain

laggy af project
tops and bottoms of blocks dont work

but it's cool ig
you put in a png
and it converts it to an mcfunction file
which you can run in a datapack
and itll put the png
as a 3d block model
make sure to use the template
and only use the colour palette shown in the template
otherwise itll cry
